Some time ago, I did a exercise for apply a job. This was the exam I
made.

I think is a good idea for practice your front-end skills. So, if you
have some time and want a challenge for sunday morning, you can try on
your own to complete the task.

The exercise seem to be very simple (it doesn’t): *create the markup of
this design for mobiles, tablets and desktop*

[Check out my
version](http://bruno.garciaechegaray.com/responsive-testing/tool_responsive.html).
Maybe I’ll improve it soon. I don’t know if the approach was the
correct, but **it works in three different devices!**.

I have [a repo in Github with the
code](https://github.com/brunogarcia/responsive-testing), check it out
too.

I used a [responsive
tool](https://github.com/mattkersley/Responsive-Design-Testing) created
by [Matt Kersley](https://github.com/mattkersley/), was very usefull.
